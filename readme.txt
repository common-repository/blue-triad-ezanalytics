The Blue Triad EZAnalytics plugin enables Google Analytics tracking by adding the tracking script code to the head section of the web pages for the site.

== Description ==
The plugin supports two modes of operation.  The user can locate and copy the Tracking Id key themselves and paste it into the plugin settings.
Alternatively, members of the Blue Triad service can use a link to the service that will allow them to log in to their Google account and automatically determine their tracking id and pass it back to the plugin.

The plugin checks to make sure the Tracking Id is valid, preventing invalid script code from being inserted into the site.
